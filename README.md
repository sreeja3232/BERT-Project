# BERTuarant

## Description

This project leverages a pre-trained BERT model for Natural Language Processing to classify restaurant reviews into positive or negative sentiments and provide a predictive score out of five. The system is integrated into a website with functionalities such as Home, Login, Register, and Search, offering both user and administrator interfaces for a dynamic experience in managing and reviewing restaurants.
